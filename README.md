What is data science?
Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden in an organizationâ€™s data. These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning.
Data science is a field of study that focuses on techniques and algorithms to extract knowledge from data. The area combines data mining and machine learning with data-specific domains. This section focuses on defining "data" before going to any complicated topic.
Python Basic Syntax 
## Python Basic Syntax
This is a basic Python program that uses the print() function to output the message "Hello, world!" to the console. It's often used as a simple starting point when learning a new programming language.
#
 print("Muhammad Ismail!")
## Variables and data types
This code demonstrates how to define variables in Python and assign them different data types. The name variable is a string, the age variable is an integer, the is_male variable is a boolean, and the height variable is a float.
#
 A=5 
B=3
 print(A+B) = 8
 Functions
This code defines a function square that takes a number as input, multiplies it by itself, and returns the result. The function is then called with an argument of 5 and the returned value is stored in the result variable. Finally, the value of result is printed to the console using the print() function.
### def square(x=5): return x*x
it print 25 which is square of five
##
In Python, you can define a function with an optional third parameter by providing a default value for the third parameter in the function definition. 
### Here's an example:

def add_num(x=2,y=3, z=None):
    if(z==None):
        return x+y
    else:
        return x+y+z
 #### p =add_num(4,5) =9	
 ## Update to take optional flag parameteer
 def add_num(x=2,y=3, z=None , flag=False):
    if(flag):
        print("flage is true")
    if(z==None):
        return x+y
    else:
        return x+y+z
	
 p =add_num(4,5, flag=True)
 ## There are several data types
 In Python programming, there are several data types that can be used to store different kinds of values. The most common data types include:
 #### Numeric types:
x = 42        # int
y = 3.14      # float
z = 1 + 2j    # complex

#### Boolean type:
is_true = True
is_false = False

#### List type
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'four', 5.0]

#### Tuple type
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'four', 5.0)

#### Dictionary type
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}

#### Set type
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Python also provides a variety of built-in functions and methods for working with these data types, such as len(), append(), remove(), and many more.






bool (True or False)
Sequence types:

list (mutable ordered sequence of elements)
tuple (immutable ordered sequence of elements)
range (immutable sequence of numbers)
str (immutable sequence of characters)
bytes (immutable sequence of bytes)
bytearray (mutable sequence of bytes)
Mapping types:

dict (mutable key-value mapping)
Set types:

set (mutable unordered collection of unique elements)
frozenset (immutable unordered collection of unique elements)
## conditional statements
In Python, conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a certain condition is true or false. The most common conditional statements in Python are if, elif, and else.
####
a=8

if(a %2 ==0):
    print("this even number")
else:
        print("this Odd number")
#### for loop
In Python, the for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable object (such as a dictionary or set) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence. The basic syntax of a for loop in Python is as follows:
#####
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for num in numbers:
    print(num)
## combine two lists
To combine two lists in Python, you can use the + operator or the extend() method. Here are examples of each method:

Method 1: Using the + operator
####
A=[1,2]
B=[3,4]
A+B = [1, 2, 3, 4]

## CSV files
In Python, you can read and write CSV files using the csv module. The csv module provides functionality for working with CSV files in a variety of formats, including comma-separated values (CSV), tab-separated values (TSV), and other delimiter-separated values.

To read a CSV file in Python, you can use the csv.reader() function. This function takes a file object as input and returns a reader object, which can be used to iterate over the rows in the CSV file. Here's an example:
####
import csv

with open('example.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
