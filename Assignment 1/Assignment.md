# Question 1
Write a function called proportion_of_education which returns the proportion of children in the dataset who had a mother with the education levels equal to less than high school (<12), high school (12), more than high school but not a college graduate (>12) and college degree.

This function should return a dictionary in the form of (use the correct numbers, do not round numbers):
#
The overall purpose of the code is to calculate the proportions of children in the dataset who have mothers with different education levels, and store the results in a dictionary. The dictionary has four key-value pairs, where the keys represent the education level categories and the values represent the corresponding proportions in the dataset. The code uses the pandas library to read the CSV file, calculate the value counts and proportions, and create the dictionary, which is then returned as the output of the function. The assertions at the end of the code are used to check that the function returns a dictionary with the correct keys and number of items.
# Question 2
Let's explore the relationship between being fed breastmilk as a child and getting a seasonal influenza vaccine from a healthcare provider. Return a tuple of the average number of influenza vaccines for those children we know received breastmilk as a child and those who know did not.

This function should return a tuple in the form (use the correct numbers:
#
import pandas as pd: This line imports the pandas library, which is a popular data manipulation library in Python.

df = pd.read_csv('assets/NISPUF17.csv'): This line reads a CSV file called 'NISPUF17.csv' and loads it into a Pandas DataFrame named df.

df1 = df[df["CBF_01"] == 1]: This line creates a new DataFrame df1 by filtering the rows in the original DataFrame df where the value in the "CBF_01" column is equal to 1. This is done using boolean indexing, where df["CBF_01"] == 1 creates a boolean mask that is used to select the rows with "CBF_01" equal to 1.

df2 = df[df["CBF_01"] == 2]: This line creates another new DataFrame df2 by filtering the rows in the original DataFrame df where the value in the "CBF_01" column is equal to 2, using the same boolean indexing technique.

return (df1["P_NUMFLU"].mean(), df2["P_NUMFLU"].mean()): This line calculates the mean of the "P_NUMFLU" column in both df1 and df2, which represent the number of influenza doses for children whose mothers answered "yes" or "no" to the "CBF_01" question, respectively. The results are returned as a tuple with two values, where the first value represents the average number of influenza doses for children whose mothers answered "yes" and the second value represents the average number of influenza doses for children whose mothers answered "no".

The assertion at the end of the code checks that the function returns a tuple with exactly two values, as specified in the instructions.

The overall purpose of the code is to calculate the average number of influenza doses for children whose mothers answered "yes" or "no" to a specific question ("CBF_01") in the dataset. The code uses pandas to read the CSV file, filter the rows based on the "CBF_01" column values, calculate the mean of the "P_NUMFLU" column for each filtered DataFrame, and return the results as a tuple with two values.

# Question 3
It would be interesting to see if there is any evidence of a link between vaccine effectiveness and sex of the child. Calculate the ratio of the number of children who contracted chickenpox but were vaccinated against it (at least one varicella dose) versus those who were vaccinated but did not contract chicken pox. Return results by sex.

This function should return a dictionary in the form of (use the correct numbers):

    {"male":0.2,
    "female":0.4}
    #
    The chickenpox_by_sex() function is designed to calculate the ratio of females and males who have had chickenpox, based on data from the 'NISPUF17.csv' file. Let's review the code step by step:

import pandas as pd: This line imports the pandas library, which is a popular data manipulation library in Python.

df = pd.read_csv('assets/NISPUF17.csv'): This line reads a CSV file called 'NISPUF17.csv' and loads it into a Pandas DataFrame named df.

df = pd.read_csv('assets/NISPUF17.csv', index_col=0): This line reads the same CSV file and sets the first column as the index column of the DataFrame. The purpose of this line is not clear, as it overrides the previously loaded DataFrame df and the index column is not used further in the code. It can be removed.

df = df[["SEX", "HAD_CPOX", "P_NUMVRC"]].dropna(): This line creates a new DataFrame df by selecting only the "SEX", "HAD_CPOX", and "P_NUMVRC" columns from the original DataFrame, and then dropping any rows with missing values using the dropna() method. This is done to ensure that only rows with complete data in these three columns are considered in the subsequent analysis.

df = df[df["P_NUMVRC"] > 0]: This line further filters the DataFrame by keeping only the rows where the value in the "P_NUMVRC" column is greater than 0, which means that the child has received at least one chickenpox vaccine dose. This is done to exclude children who have not received any chickenpox vaccine doses from the analysis.

male_df = df[df["SEX"] == 1]: This line creates a new DataFrame male_df by filtering the rows in the original DataFrame df where the value in the "SEX" column is equal to 1, which represents males.

female_df = df[df["SEX"] == 2]: This line creates a new DataFrame female_df by filtering the rows in the original DataFrame df where the value in the "SEX" column is equal to 2, which represents females.

female_chickenpox = female_df[(female_df["HAD_CPOX"] == 1) & (female_df["P_NUMVRC"] >= 1)]: This line creates a new DataFrame female_chickenpox by filtering the rows in the female_df DataFrame where the value in the "HAD_CPOX" column is equal to 1 (indicating that the child has had chickenpox) and the value in the "P_NUMVRC" column is greater than or equal to 1 (indicating that the child has received at least one chickenpox vaccine dose).

female_non_chickenpox = female_df[(female_df["HAD_CPOX"] == 2) & (female_df["P_NUMVRC"] >= 1)]: This line creates a new DataFrame female_non_chickenpox by filtering the rows in the female_df DataFrame where the value in the "HAD_CPOX" column is equal to 2 (indicating that the child has not had chickenpox) and the value in the "P_NUMVRC" column is greater than or equal to 1 (indicating that the child has received at least one chickenpox vaccine dose).
#
# Question 4
A correlation is a statistical relationship between two variables. If we wanted to know if vaccines work, we might look at the correlation between the use of the vaccine and whether it results in prevention of the infection or disease [1]. In this question, you are to see if there is a correlation between having had the chicken pox and the number of chickenpox vaccine doses given (varicella).

Some notes on interpreting the answer. The had_chickenpox_column is either 1 (for yes) or 2 (for no), and the num_chickenpox_vaccine_column is the number of doses a child has been given of the varicella vaccine. A positive correlation (e.g., corr > 0) means that an increase in had_chickenpox_column (which means more no’s) would also increase the values of num_chickenpox_vaccine_column (which means more doses of vaccine). If there is a negative correlation (e.g., corr < 0), it indicates that having had chickenpox is related to an increase in the number of vaccine doses.

Also, pval is the probability that we observe a correlation between had_chickenpox_column and num_chickenpox_vaccine_column which is greater than or equal to a particular value occurred by chance. A small pval means that the observed correlation is highly unlikely to occur by chance. In this case, pval should be very small (will end in e-18 indicating a very small number).

[1] This isn’t really the full picture, since we are not looking at when the dose was given. It’s possible that children had chickenpox and then their parents went to get them the vaccine. Does this dataset have the data we would need to investigate the timing of the dose?
#
The function corr_chickenpox() reads data from a CSV file ('assets/NISPUF17.csv') using the pandas library and performs correlation analysis between two columns in the DataFrame - "HAD_CPOX" and "P_NUMVRC". It removes rows where "HAD_CPOX" is greater than 2 or either "P_NUMVRC" or "HAD_CPOX" is missing.

The correlation coefficient and p-value are calculated using the pearsonr() function from the scipy.stats module, which computes the Pearson correlation coefficient between two arrays. The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables, with values ranging from -1 to 1. A value of 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, and 0 indicates no correlation.

The function returns the calculated correlation coefficient as the result. The assertion statement at the end checks if the returned value is a float between -1 and 1, which is the expected range for a correlation coefficient. If the assertion fails, an error message is displayed, indicating that the returned value should be a float between -1.0 and 1.0.

Note: The comment "here is some stub code to actually run the correlation" seems to be a placeholder comment and can be removed as the correlation calculation is already implemented correctly using the pearsonr() function.
